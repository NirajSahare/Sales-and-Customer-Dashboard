### Overview of dashboard:
This dashboard helps businesses enhance decision-making, improve customer engagement, and boost sales efficiency by leveraging data analytics and visualization.
The analysis reveals substantial year-over-year growth across all key metrics. However, **during the current year, profits** have experienced a significant decline following a 
sharp spike in the first three months. A similar trend is observed in the **total sales per customer**, as reflected in the customer dashboard. This pattern warrants further 
investigation to uncover potential underlying factors. Possible causes for these fluctuations may include inflationary pressures, pricing strategy adjustments, seasonal 
demand variations, supply chain disruptions, shifts in customer behavior.

A deeper analysis of these factors can provide valuable insights for addressing these fluctuations and optimizing business strategies.

## Sales Dashboard Purpose:
The purpose of sales dashboard is to present an overview of the sales metrics and trends in order to analyze year-over-year sales performance and understand sales trends.

### 1. Summary of total sales, profits, and quantity for the current year and the previous year.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were leveraged to analyze monthly trends in total sales, total profits, and total quantities for the current and previous years. The analysis 
focused on identifying key performance patterns, including the highest and lowest monthly values. Findings reveal a **20.36% increase in total sales**, a **14.24% increase in 
total profit**, and a **26.38% growth in total quantity sold** compared to the prior year. This data highlights significant year-over-year improvements in overall business performance.

### 2. Yearly sales and profit trends along with product subcategory comparisons.
**With the exception of machines, envelopes, and fasteners**, sales for all other product categories have shown an increase. However, losses have been observed in the sales of products 
such as tables, machines, and supplies. This decline in performance may be attributed to the impact of discounting and promotional offers applied to these product categories.

### 3. Sales and profit trends over time.
The analysis showcases that while total sales have been consistently increasing, **profits have remained within an average range** of values. This indicates that despite higher sales volumes, 
profitability has not experienced a proportional increase, potentially due to factors such as pricing strategies, cost structures, or the impact of discounts and promotions.

## Customer Dashboard Purpose:
Customer Dashboard focuses on customer trends and segmentation, revealing insights into customer loyalty and profitability.

### 1. Summary of total customers, sales per customer, and orders.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for total customers, total sales per customer, and total orders were analyzed and compared against the previous year. The data reveals an **8.62% increase in 
total customer**s, a **10.8% increase in total sales per customer**, and a **28.29% increase in total orders**, indicating positive growth across all key metrics.

### 2. Top 10 customers by profit along with the number of orders.
The analysis highlights the **top 10 loyal customers** who have contributed the highest profits ans sales to the company. This group represents a key segment of the customer base, offering 
significant value through high-margin purchases. Identifying and understanding the behaviors and preferences of these customers can provide actionable insights for enhancing customer retention strategies and 
driving long-term profitability.
